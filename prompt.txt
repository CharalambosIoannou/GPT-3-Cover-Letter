Output: Dear Recruiter,

I had the opportunity to work closely with Jane Smith, an A.T. Kiley consultant in the Higher Education Practice, as a member of XYZ University's Presidential Search Committee. This was my first exposure to the consulting profession, and it was a perfect match for someone with my academic record, communication and leadership skills, and drive to succeed.

I have shown initiative, creativity in problem-solving, and a commitment to building consensus and excellence throughout our college community during the last four years. As an intern in the Office of the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education, I worked with the Senior Advising team to provide accurate, effective, and concise statistical and anecdotal data to a variety of constituents in order to support legislative proposals. I combined the written and oral skills I have gained from courses in American Studies and Government with quantitative and analytical training in a high-intensity environment.

As Vice President of Academic Affairs for the Student Government Association and a student representative on several college committees (including the one which nominated the sixth President of XYZ University), I have learned: to use language precisely and effectively, to articulate well to a range of audiences, the value of integrity and persistence in working toward short- and long-term personal and institutional goals. The opportunity to effect positive change for a range of institutions is the most attractive aspect of consulting for me. Employees have described A.T. Kiley as "down to earth" and as having an "open culture."

I feel lucky to have been part of a college community whose openness has allowed for measured risks and the candor necessary to achieve its goals, and I hope to begin my career in a similarly rigorous and collegial environment where can I learn from industry leaders. I look forward to exploring further my opportunities at A.T. Kiley and will call next week to see if it is possible to arrange an interview.

Sincerely,
